<h1>Setting form options</h1>
<section>
	<p>MyAMS <code>form</code> module provides a generic way to manage forms submissions, which
	can be customized in many ways.</p>
	<p>There are three ways to define custom settings:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>by setting data attributes on the form;</p></li>
		<li><p>by setting data attributes on the button which is used to submit the form;</p>
		<li><p>by setting attributes in the <code>options</code> parameter of
		<code>MyAMS.form.submit()</code> function, when you submit a form by code.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>All <i>data</i> attributes can be set using an <code>ams-form</code> prefix; for example,
	you can set the <code>initData</code> callback name using <code>data-ams-form-init-data</code>
	attribute, applied to the form or to the submit button, or just by setting the
	<code>options.initData</code> property.</p>
	<p>If the same setting is found several times (for example, on the form and in the
	<code>MyAMS.form.submit()</code> options), the options have priority over button data
	attributes, button data attributes have priority over form data attributes, and form data
	attributes have priority over MyAMS default settings.</p>
	<p>Callbacks can be defined via data attributes by giving their name, which must be found in
	the global scope (eventually using a dotted namespace, for example
	<code>MyAMS.form.resetChanged</code>); if set using options, they can be provided by their
	name of by using a function object, as in:<br />
	<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;MyAMS.form.submit(form, url, {resetChanged: MyAMS.myapp.form.resetChanged});
	</code></p>
	<p>Most defined callbacks receive the form and the computed settings object as first
	arguments.</p>
	<p>Here is the options list:</p>
	<table class="table table-sm">

				twice.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>getValidators</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>getValidators(form, settings): Map&lt;form, validator&gt;</code><br />
				This function is used to extract a list of <code>validators</code> from the
				submitted form; the default MyAMS implementation is using a
				<code>data-ams-form-validator</code> to extract this list.<br />
				See <a href="#mod-form-validators.html">Using validators</a> to know how to use
				them.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>checkValidators</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>checkFormValidators(form, settings): Promise&lt;status&gt;</code><br />
				This function is used to <i>check</i> form validators which are loaded by
				<code>getValidators()</code>; it returns a <code>Promise</code>, which is
				resolved when all the validators, if any, have been resolved! The Promise
				value is a <code>status code</code> based on the result value of each
				validator.<br />
				See <a href="#mod-form-validators.html">Using validators</a> to know how to use
				them.

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>clearAlerts</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>clearAlerts(form, settings)</code><br />

				time.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>initSubmitButton</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>initSubmitButton(form, settings, button)</code><br />
				This function is used to initialize the submit button state.<br />
				By default, the submit button is disabled and it's label is changed by adding
				"..." to it's label. You can provide an alternate text by setting a
				<code>data-ams-loading-text</code> attribute on the button; a <code>progress</code>
				element is also added to the button, to be able to display upload progress (see
				<a href="#mod-form-progress.html">Progress indicators</a>).<br />
				If the submit button only contains an image, it's HTML content is replaced by
				a spinning wheel, after saving it's original content into it's
				<code>original-html</code> data attribute.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>resetSubmitButton</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>resetSubmitButton(form, settings, button)</code><br />
				This function is used to reset submit button state.<br />
				By default, the submit button contents are restored, and it's "disabled"
				state is removed.<br />
				This function is also called if an error occurs, to be able to submit the
				form another time.

			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>initFormData</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>initFormData(form, settings, button, postData, options, veto)</code><br />
				This function is used to initialize form data extracted by the
				<code>getFormData</code> function.<br />
				If the <code>veto</code> object is updated with a <code>true</code> value in his
				<code>veto</code> attribute, the submit button is reset and the submit operation
				is cancelled.
				After initialization is done, an <code>init-data.myams.form</code> event is
				triggered on the form, with <code>postData</code> and <code>veto</code> arguments.

		<tr>
			<td><code>initTarget</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>initTarget(form, settings, target)</code><br />
				This function is used to initialize form's submit target, as returned by the
				<code>getTarget()</code> function call.<br />
				By default, the target is cleared and replaced by a spinning wheel; if
				settings <code>submitMessage</code> attribute is set, it's value is also
				included into submit target until server's response is received.<br />
				If the target is included into any DOM element with a <code>hidden</code>, this

			<td><code>getAction</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>getAction(form, settings, handler)</code><br />
				This function is used to extract absolute URL of form's action. The base URL

				one, this value is concatenated with current base URL.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>getAjaxSettings</code></td>
			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>getAjaxSettings(form, settings, button, postData, action, target)</code><br />
				This function is used to initialize settings of JQuery.form plug-in

			<td>string</td>
			<td>
				Name of a POST field used to identify current progress operation. This field
				is initialized on the client side using <code>MyAMS.core.generateUUID()</code>

				format, but also to call a specific function; this callback can be set in server's
				response using a dedicated <code>X-AMS-Callback</code> HTTP header, and another
				<code>X-AMS-Callback-Options</code> header to define callback options in a

			<td>function</td>
			<td>
				<code>resetAfterSubmit(form, defaults, button</code><br />
