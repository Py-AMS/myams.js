<h1>Modal forms</h1>
<section data-ams-modules="modal">
	<p>Modal forms are nothing but classic forms, but which are displayed into a modal dialog.</p>
	<p>You can see an example of a modal form <a href="mod-form-modal-sample.html"
	data-toggle="modal">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Everything is handled as in a classic modal and in a classic form, except for the following
	points:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>the modal is closed automatically after submit, except if errors occured or if
			an attribute into JSON response is set for the modal to be kept open.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>you can assign a target on a modal form as well; this target will be updated with
			submit's response content, as usual. See <a href="mod-form-modal-target.html"
			data-toggle="modal">this example</a>, just submit the form to see how it works!</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
