<h1>MyAMS "callbacks" module</h1>

<section>
	<p>MyAMS callbacks are callable elements which are loaded. Callbacks are initialized in the
	context of a DOM element but unlike plug-ins, they are not kept into browser's memory
	for future use, so they must be declared each time their use is required.</p>
	<p>Each callback can be defined using several data attributes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<code>data-ams-callback</code>: this is the name of the callback function;
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>data-ams-callback-source</code>: source URL of file containing callback
			definition; this can contain variables if enclosed between braces;
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>data-ams-callback-options</code>: JSON object containing callback options.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="alert alert-warning mx-3">
		<h5 class="alert-heading">
			Warning!
		</h5>
		<p>Always keep in mind that callbacks are executed in asynchronous mode, even when they
		don't need to be downloaded!</p>
	</div>
