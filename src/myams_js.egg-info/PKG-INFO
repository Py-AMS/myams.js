        What is PyAMS?
        ==============
        
        PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applications
        and content management with the Pyramid framework.
        
        **PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,
        see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of web
        application.
        
        All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyams.readthedocs.io>`_; source code
        is available on `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/pyams>`_ and pushed to `Github
        <https://github.com/py-ams>`_.
        
        
        What is MyAMS.js?
        =================
        
        MyAMS.js is a "small" extension package over JQuery and Bootstrap. It provides a small set of
        features using the HTML "data" API to enable components configuration without using any
        javascript code.
        
        MyAMS documentation and demo site is available at http://myams.ztfy.org.
        
        Please note that this package also includes a Python package, for easy integration of MyAMS.js
        within a Pyramid application.
        
        
        MyAMS upgrade
        =============
         - three available versions: full package "myams.js" (including JQuery, Bootstrap and FontAwesome,
           with all MyAMS extensions and modules), "myams-mini.js" (including only MyAMS extensions and
           modules) and "myams-core.js" (including only base MyAMS extensions, but no module)
         - all MyAMS modules can now be downloaded automatically using MyAMS.require; you may check
           all modules before using them, to be able to change your MyAMS packaging mode as you want
         - all synchronous downloads should now be forbidden! An "async=false" attribute is still
           available when defining plug-ins, but it is just used to load "not-async" plug-ins after the
           other ones, but always in an asynchronous way...
         - upgraded to JQuery 3.4, Bootstrap 4.4 and FontAwesome 5.12
         - move MyAMS.plugins to MyAMS.registry (refactored)
         - plug-ins are now called with "element" and "context" arguments, without using "this"; "element"
           is the DOM source element which is updated, "context" is the context to which plug-in is attached
         - move MyAMS.dialog to MyAMS.modal
         - removed Bootstrap modalmanager
         - calling "MyAMS.modal.close" without argument is now closing the upper modal
         - mode MyAMS.event to MyAMS.events
         - removed widgets and utf8 modules
