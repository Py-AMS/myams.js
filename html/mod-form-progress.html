<h1>Progress indicators</h1>
<section>
	<p>There are two facts of progress indicators to manage:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>upload progress is used when a form contains input files, whose upload can be quite
		long;</li>
		<li>server progress is used when submit action is handled by a server operation which
		can also be long!</li>
	</ul>
</section>

	<h2>Upload progress</h2>
	<p>There is no special need to handle upload progress: everything is handled automatically
	by MyAMS, but you can always override this default behaviour.</p>
	<p>When you submit a form, a <code>.progress</code> DIV element is created insite form's
	submit button; this gauge is updated automatically with a linear green and red gradient
	background when	file upload is in progress.</p>

	<h2>Server progress</h2>
	<p>Server progress handler requires a server handler which is not available in this
	environment without an application server, so no example is available.</p>
	<p>When you want to show that a long server-side operation is in progress, MyAMS is updating
	form's submit button text with values sent by the server which are checked on a regular basis;
	several steps are required to handle this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			you must provide a <em>progress handler</em>: using form's
			<code>progressHandler</code> option (see <a href="#mod-form-options.html">forms
			options</a>), you define an URL which will be called to get processing status of this
			operation;
		</li>
		<li>
			this operation must be defined by a unique ID; MyAMS is generating an UUID, which
			will be send in form's submit data in a field identified by the
			<code>progressFieldName</code> option (default is <code>progressId</code>);
		</li>
		<li>
			on a regular basis (defined by <code>progressTimeout</code> option, set to 1000ms
			by default), a new request is send to defined progress handler to check status of
			the current operation.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These long operations can be separated between those for which the number of operations
	is known from the beginning of the operation, and those for which this value is unknown
	until the end but for which we can display a kind of counter; so progress handler response
	is a JSON object which can contain several attributes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<code>status</code>: may be <code>running</code> as long as the operation is
			executing, or <code>finished</code> when the operation is over; when the operation
			is finished, form's submit button text is reset;
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>message</code>: if this attribute is present, form's submit button text is
			replaced with given text, without using other attributes;
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>progress</code>: this label is used to update form's submit button text; if
			not defined, a lookup is made into button's <code>ams-progress-text</code> data
			attribute, or by using MyAMS's default value;
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>current</code>: this kind of <i>counter</i> is used to display the number of
			<i>items</i> which have already been processed by the server;
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>length</code>: this is the total number of <i>items</i> that the server should
			process; if <code>current</code> value is given without <code>length</code>, we use
			a value of <code>100</code> as default length.
		</li>
	</ul>
