<h1>Initializing contents</h1>
<section>
	<p>MyAMS allows you to download or generate HTML content dynamically; when such a content
	contains elements which may be handled via plug-ins, they have to be initialized as well!</p>
	<p>The <a href="#core.html!initContent"><code>MyAMS.core.initContent(element)</code></a>
	function (which can be overriden using data attributes or by changing MyAMS default
	configuration, see <a href="#core.html">core</a> module description) is used to initialize any
	HTML content included dynamically into the DOM; this function will call the
	<code>initElement(element)</code> function of all MyAMS <a href="#modules.html">modules</a>
	which have been loaded, for example to handle any form or skin element included into these
	parts, before calling <a href="#registry.html!run"><code>MyAMS.registry.run(element)</code></a>
	to be able to initialize all registered plug-ins into the new content.</p>
	<p>You can disable using MyAMS plug-ins registry; this can be done globally by setting
	<code>MyAMS.config.useRegistry</code> to <code>false</code>, or by setting attribute
	<code>data-ams-disable-registry</code> to <code>true</code> on the initialized element.</p>
