	<h2>General form submit workflow</h2>
	<p>Forms are a very common use case into web applications.</p>
	<p>MyAMS handles AJAX forms using the <a href="https://github.com/jquery-form/form"
	target="_blank">JQuery form plug-in</a>, but is adding a few features to correctly handle all
	aspects of form submission.</p>
	<p>MyAMS provides a general use case mechanism, but provides many entry points which can be
	used to customize this default behaviour.</p>
	<p>General submit workflow proposed by MyAMS is described in the following diagram; this
	workflow is applied	automatically for all forms with the <code>data-async</code> attribute
	set (other forms being submitted without using AJAX):</p>
	<p class="text-center">
		<img src="resources/img/form-submit.png" alt="Form submission process" />
	</p>
	<p>All underlined functions names have default implementations provided by MyAMS, but each
	of them can be overriden, using data attributes applied to the form or to the button used to
	submit the form, or given in the <code>options</code> parameter of <code>MyAMS.form.submit
	</code> function; see <a href="#mod-form-options.html">setting form options</a> to know
	which settings can be used.</p>
	<p>The whole validation process is done by the <a href="#plugin-validate.html">validate</a>
	plug-in; if the client validation rules are accepted, the form is submitted using MyAMS
	<code>form.submit()</code> function.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info mx-3">
		<p>If you don't want to use this plug-in and MyAMS validation and submission
		process, set form's <code>novalidate</code> attribute to <code>novalidate</code>.</p>
		<p>If you want to validate your form but use a classic form's <code>submit</code>, just
		remove the <code>data-async</code> attribute.</p>
	</div>
