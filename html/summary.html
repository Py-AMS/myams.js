	<h1 class="display-4">Welcome to MyAMS!</h1>
	<p class="lead">This is the documentation and testing environment of MyAMS features.</p>
	<p>This documentation is not written for end users, but for software developers who want
	to include MyAMS into their projects; you can use menus on the left to discover main MyAMS
	components and features...</p>
	<p>MyAMS is a small library applied on top of JQuery and Bootstrap; targeted mainly to
	build applications management interfaces, it provides a small set of additional
	features, as well as a selection of plug-ins which can be used as "default" for
	common use cases, which can be included and configured using pure HTML "data" API; no
	Javascript code is required!</p>
	<p>Of course, MyAMS also provides a set of features which you can use in your own
	applications; many MyAMS aspects are "pluggable" and can be replaced quite easilly.</p>
	<p>MyAMS is a client-only library, and is supposed to be independent of any server-side
	implementation.</p>
