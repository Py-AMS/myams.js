<h1>Managing server response</h1>
<section>
	<p>When submitting a form, several typical responses types can be received:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p><b>JSON</b> response: the server send a JSON response containing properties defining
			how the response should be treated. This JSON response is handled by MyAMS <a
			href="#mod-ajax.html!handleJSON">AJAX module</a>, including errors management.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>HTML</b> response: the server send an HTML response which is directly placed
			into a <i>target</i> element ; see <a href="#mod-form-options.html">form options</a>
			to know all form settings.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>text</b> response: as for HTML responses, the received text is placed into a
			<i>target</i> element.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>file</b> response: the server send a file object which may be downloaded and
			saved by the browser. This process generally requires the creation of a dedicated
			iframe, which is done automatically by MyAMS as soon as a few conditions are
			required; this configuration is described into <a href="#mod-form-download.html">
			Managing file downloads</a> section.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
