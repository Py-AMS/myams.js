<h1>MyAMS "form" module API</h1>

<section>
	<p>MyAMS "form" module contains many functions which are used to handle forms in all their
	aspects, from user inputs checking to submission and handling of server's response.</p>
	<p>Many forms management features can be overriden using data attributes assigned to a form,
	to the button used to submit a form or via the "options" object provided when you submit a
	form by code.</p>
	<p>See <a href="#mod-form-options.html">form options</a> to get the list of available
	settings.</p>
</section>

<section id="checkBeforeUnload">
	<h2><code>MyAMS.form.checkBeforeUnload()</code></h2>
	<p>This function is called when the browser's window is closed; if a modified form is found
	into this window, the function will return a string message which will be displayed
	by the browser to be able to cancel the operation.</p>
</section>

<section id="clearAlerts">
	<h2><code>MyAMS.form.clearAlerts(form)</code></h2>
	<p>This function is used to remove alerts and validation error messages located into a
	form; only <i>danger</i> alerts using <code>alert-danger</code> CSS class are removed; if you
	need to keep these alerts visible after reset, just add a <code>persistent</code> class to
	them</p>
</section>

<section id="confirmChangedForm">
	<h2><code>MyAMS.form.confirmChangedForm(element): Promise&lt;string&gt;</code></h2>
	<p>This function is used to display a confirmation message if a modified form is located
	into the provided <code>element</code>; if so, the function returns a Promise which is
	resolved with a value matching the user's decision, which can be <code>success</code> if
	the form confirmed that the form can be closed, or <code>cancel</code> otherwise; if no
	form is found, the function returns a Promise which is resolved directly with a
	<code>success</code> value.</p>
</section>

<section id="customResetHandler">
	<h2><code>MyAMS.form.customResetHandler(event)</code></h2>
	<p>In addition to default reset handlers, you can add a custom reset handler on a form using
	a <code>data-ams-reset-handler</code> attribute on a form; the value of the attribute is the
	dotted name of a callback which will be called on reset; callback arguments are the original
	event, the form and the value of <code>data-ams-reset-handler-options</code> attribute, if
	any.</p>
</section>

<section id="getSettings">
	<h2><code>MyAMS.form.getSettings(form, formData, button, buttonData, options): object</code></h2>
	<p>This function is used to get a form's settings object, and is called automatically by MyAMS
	when a form is submitted; see <a href="#mod-form-options.html">form options</a> to get the
	list of available options.</p>
	<p><code>form</code> is the form for which we want to get settings, and <code>formData</code>
	is the value of it's data attributes; <code>button</code> is the button used to submit the
	form, and <code>buttonData</code> is the value of it's data attributes; <code>options</code>
	is an object which can be provided when a form is submitted using custom javascript code.</p>
	<p>The provided arguments are merged together to create a completed settings object;
	default settings are overwritten by all form's data attributes starting with
	<code>ams-form-*</code>, then by button's data attributes starting with <code>ams-form-*</code>
	and finally by <code>options</code> properties; please note however that <code>options</code>
	object can only override settings with existing properties: properties which don't exist in
	the settings object will not be added.</p>

<section id="handleDefaultReset">
	<h2><code>MyAMS.form.handleDefaultReset(form)</code></h2>
	<p>This function is used to handle <i>default</i> reset events on the given form; if required,
	you can define additional callbacks which will be called on reset, by giving their names
	in a <code>data-ams-reset-callback</code> attribute, separated by spaces, commas or semicolons;
	these callbacks will be called with three arguments which are the form, the source element on
	which the callback was applied and the content of <code>data-ams-reset-callback-options</code>
	attribute, if any.</p>
