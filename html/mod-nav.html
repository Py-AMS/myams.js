<h1>MyAMS "nav" module</h1>
<section>
	<p>MyAMS's <code>nav</code> module is used to handle navigation into the web application. It
	defines navigation menus creation, and handles several kinds of links as already explained
	into <a href="#navigation.html">Links and navigation with MyAMS</a>.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Navigation menus</h2>
	<p>Navigation menus are an important part of any web application; a page is dedicated to
	them in the <i>Layout</i> section (see <a href="#nav.html">Navigation menus</a>), where you
	can discover how to create them.</p>
</section>

	<h2>Module API</h2>

	<section class="m-2" id="NavigationMenu">
		<h3><code>class NavigationMenu</code></h3>
		<p>This class is used internally by MyAMS to create menus and register events handlers.
		But the class is exported so that you can use it in your own code if required.</p>

		<section class="m-1">
			<h3><code>NavigationMenu.constructor(menus, parent, settings)</code></h3>
			<p>The constructor receives three arguments which are the menus definition object, the
			parent into which menus are to be added, and the component settings; definition object
			can be null if menus definition is already included into HTML code. See <a
			href="#nav.html">Navigation menus</a> to know how menus are defined.</p>
			<p>Settings is an object which can provide several attributes: <code>accordion</code>
			is a boolean value specifying if menu should be used in accordion mode or not, and is
			<code>true</code> unless explicitly defined to <code>false</code>; <code>speed</code>
			is a number which specifies how quickly the menu items are opened or closed; default
			value is 200 and is given in milliseconds.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="m-1">
			<h3><code>NavigationMenu.getMenus()</code></h3>
			<p>This method is used to create HTML elements from menus definition provided to
			the constructor, using internal <code>Menu</code> and <code>MenuHeader</code>
			classes.</p>
			<p>Please note that the method is creating and returns HTML elements, but without
			including them into the DOM.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="m-1">
			<h3><code>NavigationMenu.init(menus)</code></h3>
			<p>This method receives menus as HTML elements created by the <code>getMenus</code>
			method. She goes through all menus items, adds aditional elements if required (like
			opening/closing signs on items with sub-menus), and sets CSS classes on active menus.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="m-1">
			<h3><code>NavigationMenu.render()</code></h3>
			<p>This method is calling the <code>getMenus()</code> method to create menus, then
			<code>init()</code> to initialize them; the menus are then added to the DOM.</p>
		</section>
	</section>

	<section class="m-2" id="init">
		<h3><code>MyAMS.nav.init()</code></h3>
		<p>This function is called automatically by MyAMS after module loading. She creates a
		JQuery <code>$().navigationMenu()</code> components, which is using the
		<code>NavigationMenu</code> class.</p>
		<p>If <a href="#config.html!ajaxNav"><code>MyAMS.config.ajaxNav</code></a> is set to
		<code>true</code> (which is the default), this module also registers events handlers
		which are used to handle all navigation links, including those which are created into
		MyAMS navigation menu.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="m-2" id="initElement">
		<h3><code>MyAMS.nav.initElement(element)</code></h3>
		<p>This function is called automatically by MyAMS on content initialization. It's only
		action is actually to create a navigation menu from the <code>nav</code> HTML element.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="m-2" id="setActiveMenu">
		<h3><code>MyAMS.nav.setActiveMenu(menu)</code></h3>
		<p>This function is used to <i>activate</i> the menu given as argument. This activation
		will highlight the menu, and the navigation bar will be scrolled if necessary so that
		the activated menu is made visible.</p>
		<p>This function is generally called automatically by MyAMS on any menu click.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="m-2" id="drawBreadcrumbs">
		<h3><code>MyAMS.nav.drawBreadcrumbs()</code></h3>
		<p>As explained in the <a href="#ribbon.html">Breadcrumbs ribbon</a>'s page of MyAMS
		layout section, breadcrumbs are also handled automatically when navigation menus are used;
		the activated menu is used to draw breadcrumbs.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="m-2" id="minifyMenu">
		<h3><code>MyAMS.nav.minifyMenu(evt)</code></h3>
		<p>This function is used as a click event handler of navigation menu minifying button (see
		<a href="#nav.html">Navigation menus</a> in MyAMS's layout section).</p>
		<p>The navigation menu is minified by adding a <code>minified</code> class to the page
		body; the minifying state is then stored into local storage, and set automatically
		on page reload.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="m-2" id="switchMenu">
		<h3><code>MyAMS.nav.switchMenu(evt)</code></h3>
		<p>This function is used as a click event handler of navigation menus show/hide button,
		located on the top right of the window (see <a href="#show-menu.html">Show/hide menus</a>
		in MyAMS layout section).</p>
		<p>The navigation menu is shown or hidden by adding a <code>hidden-menu</code> class to
		the page body; the state of the menus is stored into local storage, and set automatically
		on page reload.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="m-2" id="restoreState">
		<h3><code>MyAMS.nav.restoreState()</code></h3>
		<p>This function is used to restore state of navigation menus by looking into local
		storage.</p>
	</section>
